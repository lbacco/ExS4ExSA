0	NEG	This is an awful movie from just about every point of view.	1	2	1	2
0	NEG	"Since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews, let me just focus on ""Serbs"" and ""Delta Force"" guys in this movie."				
0	NEG	"1) The uniforms that ""Serbs"" wear are not Serbian."				
0	NEG	And helmets are wrong, too.				
0	NEG	"2) The actors who play ""Serbs"" are not speaking Serbian, not even a language close to Serbian, unlike in ""Behind enemy lines"" where the Czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie."		3		3
0	NEG	"3) The gray-bearded ""Serbian general"" looks and acts like a moron, firing his gun whenever US soldiers call his name:  - US soldier: ""Gravic!"				
0	NEG	"Give up!"""				
0	NEG	"- Gray-bearded moronic general: (fires his AK47) - US soldier: ""Gravic!"				
0	NEG	"Come out!"""				
0	NEG	"- GBMG: (fires his AK47) - US soldier: ""Gravic!"				
0	NEG	"You're surrounded"" - GBMG: (fires his AK47) - Prop guy: ""Excuse me, Mr. gray-bearded moronic general, see, we're out of blanks and I sent the boy to buy some more, but he's not back yet..."" - GBMG: (click) 4) Since when does the Army issue AK47s to the Delta Force?"				
0	NEG	I guess they couldn't find enough working M4s in Bulgaria, but there were plenty of old AK47s and practice blanks ;) Maybe they should have went for some airsofts, they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway... 5) In the scene where a DF officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time.				
0	NEG	No sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that.	3		3	
0	NEG	I guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way.				
0	NEG	This movie is such an insult to common sense..	2	1	2	1
1	POS	We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.	1			
1	POS	This film delved into the fear we all have.				
1	POS	Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.				
1	POS	The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent.		3		3
1	POS	It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.	3			
1	POS	I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out.				
1	POS	I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.			3	
1	POS	This film doesn't take the easy way out.

2	NEG	"This version of ""The Magic Flute"" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera that I have ever seen, it is also the worst video production I have seen of any opera."	1	1	1	1
2	NEG	I'm a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies.				
2	NEG	The sets are cheap and cheesy.	2		3	
2	NEG	Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume.				
2	NEG	He is just dressed like some guy.				
2	NEG	The sound is in mono.				
2	NEG	The color is really bad.	3			
2	NEG	It is saturated in orange.				
2	NEG	Most DVD's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one.				
2	NEG	Also, the language has been changed to Swedish instead of the original German.				
2	NEG	"This is not a movie version of ""The Magic Flute."""				
2	NEG	It is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well.		3	2	3
2	NEG	You can pick any other available DVD of this opera and I guarantee it will be better than this one.		2		2
2	NEG	My preference is for the version conducted by James Levine with sets by David Hockney.				
2	NEG					
3	POS	Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen.			3	
3	POS	I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist.				
3	POS	The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.				
3	POS	The title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images, both real and hallucinated, that people in the desert often witness.				
3	POS	These are also known as mirages.				
3	POS	The film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again.				
3	POS	With each plane landing shot, the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective imagery.				
3	POS	The imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues.				
3	POS	The narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera.	3			
3	POS	The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films whatever he sees and finds.				
3	POS	The strangest reflections of the world are on display in the distance while Herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders that you are ever likely to see.				
3	POS	When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack kicks in, you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universe.				
3	POS	I cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything, but I will say that it is a sobering experience and there's really nothing like it.	1	3	2	3
3	POS	I love seeing films that are just in classes of their own.		2	1	2
3	POS	This film certainly is a good example of how Herzog loves to intermingle narrative storytelling and documentary film-making into an interchangeable form.	2	1		1
4	NEG	Whenever I see a video like this, I have to ask myself how it was financed.	1		3	
4	NEG	HBO or Showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions -- to hire someone who may or may not actually speak English to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot, to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed dudes' torsos, to find people to design and light sets, to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music, etc.				
4	NEG	But I have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer...	3	3		3
4	NEG	He had to have nailed all of those girls, right?				
4	NEG	"And bro's not wrong about the ""Spanish looking"" girl, but to call the cops ""stunning"" is awfully generous."				
4	NEG	"In fact, I'd go so far as to call them something much closer to ""hideous,"" or ""fugly."""				
4	NEG	Watching these women writhe around -- sometimes *clearly* high on pain killers -- was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body.		2		2
4	NEG	Gross.			1	
4	NEG	Why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet?	2	1	2	1

5	POS	Others have revealed spoilers, but I won't.				
5	POS	It was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but I went along with it completely.				
5	POS	Camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it.				
5	POS	But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin or ridiculous.			3	
5	POS	I don't know why she was even interested in a loser like James Franco, but married him anyway.				
5	POS	I like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job.	3			
5	POS	He has nothing to be ashamed of.				
5	POS	There have been movies with with similar setups e.g.				
5	POS	"""Ghost""."				
5	POS	I simply love Sienna Miller and went along with the situation as written in the script.				
5	POS	I feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public.				
5	POS	I thought all of the actors played their parts very well, and hope more people get to see the movie.		3		3
5	POS	I highly recommend it.	2	2	1	2
5	POS	I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had about 10 copies available.				
6	NEG	I'm an atheist.				
6	NEG	To me history and truth mean a lot.				
6	NEG	This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book.	3	2		2
6	NEG	Well it's not.				
6	NEG	The movie is about the novels 1950s version.				
6	NEG	Some actors were GREAT but that doesn't cover the plot.	2	1	1	1
6	NEG	In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene.				
6	NEG	The devil analogy persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man.				
6	NEG	What is the spirit of man anyway?				
6	NEG	And why was the first defendant Adam?				
6	NEG	Eventually you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time.	1	3	3	3
6	NEG	Though other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored.				
6	NEG	First we get the caveman story.				
6	NEG	The women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress.			2	
6	NEG	Real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant.				
7	POS	"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth."			2	
7	POS	The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it.	1	2	1	2
7	POS	"It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions""."				
7	POS	I have to say it is not for the American viewers.				
7	POS	It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater.

7	POS	Disagree with everything in it but I for one stand by it.		3		3
7	POS	It's not for the empty minds.				
7	POS	It is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense.				
7	POS	I loved Owen's words and the poem made me cry.	3	1		1
7	POS					
8	NEG	'This Life' is truly as bad as it gets.	1	1	1	1
8	NEG	Its cast of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, duplicitous, shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post-eighties setting and I have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation.	2	3	2	3
8	NEG	Unfortunately, it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and I regard it as just another step toward the television premium-rate phone in scams; astonishingly bad, cheap, reality and 'celebrity' saturated television; and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and, indeed, much of British society.	3	2	3	2
8	NEG	Sounds exaggerated?

9	POS	Now, it's all coming back to me....				
9	POS	"It was one of Naughton's first movies (as well as Fox's) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also pick out Kaplan (Henry from TV's ""Alice""), Fiedler (he does the voice of Piglet in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" cartoons) and Blocker (son of Dan ""Hoss"" Blocker from TV's ""Bonanza"")."				
9	POS	"But the two that stand out in my mind are Furst (from ""Animal House"") and the superdude himself - Eddie Deezen."	3			
9	POS	"Furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad, ""Why can't you just accept me for who I am?"""				
9	POS	"His dad looks over his obese, slovenly frame and gives a simple, one-word response - ""Yuck!"""

9	POS	As for the film, it's typical early-'80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus: the jocks, the nerds, the rich kids, the feminists or the group made up of a little of each.

10	NEG	I wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite tiresome and plain.	1	1	1	1
10	NEG	The plot line was interesting, a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids, but the laughs were few and far between.	2			
10	NEG	The jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes.	3	2	2	2
10	NEG	The characters weren't intriguing and I didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group.		3		3
10	NEG	It was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that I would recommend.			3	
10	NEG	Comparing it to other films in the same genre, ie, American Pie is just cruel, because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty.

11	POS	In the case of New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added TEOS out-takes... Calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil.				
11	POS	I've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by Neoclassical Economics - and also as a vehicle for educating about: peak oil, our wastrel land use, global warming, our threatened food production, public transit our compromised future Move over South Park!		3		3

12	NEG	"You're in for dark, harrowing films like ""Alice"" and ""Little Otik,"" or short gems such as ""Down to the Cellar"" and ""Jabberwocky."""				
12	NEG	All of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.				
12	NEG	On the other hand, when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry.	2	3	3	3
12	NEG	Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights.

14	NEG	This was supposed to be a comedy?	1			
14	NEG	Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level).

16	NEG	My gosh, that smile of hers could melt through titanium.

17	POS	"One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany, ""This is so... high school!"""				
17	POS	while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it...

17	POS	Camilla Belle did really well in this movie, and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her.				
17	POS	And I must admit, this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.	2	3	3	3
17	POS	Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen.				
17	POS	And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary... We all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives, but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen.				
17	POS	The only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most clichÃ© movies I've ever seen.				
17	POS	It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had- turning the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with suspense, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream, etc.				
17	POS	At the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall, I would give it a 7/10.	3		1	
17	POS	It's definitely worth seeing.	1	1	2	1
17	POS	By the way, This is my first review, so I don't know if any of those things were spoilers..				
18	NEG	Laughable would be a good term to describe this movie.		3		3
18	NEG	But, since this movie deserves nothing good said of it, I'll use the term god-awful instead.	1	1	1	1
18	NEG	Centering around the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent.				
18	NEG	Michael Pare (a real actor!				
18	NEG	But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy...) leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase-and-gobble-hapless-victim scenes.				
18	NEG	There is some vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does.				
18	NEG	"As if this doesn't insult the viewer enough, the movie also features what I'll call ""Guns of never-ending ammunition""."	3			
18	NEG	I never saw Mickey Parrot or his female side-kick change clips once during the entire film, yet I can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon.				
18	NEG	Forty rounds may not seem like that many, but we are talking standard handguns here.				
18	NEG	I figure 15 round clip, tops.				
18	NEG	And remember, they never change clips, nor even appear to carry any extra ammo.				
18	NEG	It's dumb-assery like this which consigns movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so.	2	2	2	2
18	NEG	The third-rate CGI does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at, else you'll start crying.			3

21	POS	"I've often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's ""Tempest"" has little to do with Shakespeare's original."				
21	POS	In my opinion, that is both true and false, but most of all, it's a bad starting point for offering critique.				
21	POS	A work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't, but for what it is.				
21	POS	"The movie ""Tempest"" is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play, but to my mind, it is faithful to Shakespeare's work in spirit."	2			
21	POS	"What ""Tempest"" is, then, is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time."	1	1		1
21	POS	No, not experimental as in hand- held camera and mumbled dialogue, but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings.				
21	POS	Mazursky's Tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyous, full of life, but most of all, it is imaginative.				
21	POS	Cassavetes portrayal of Philip/Prospero is in itself worth a 10/10 rating, and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, the dialogue, the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture...	3		3

22	NEG	Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America.				
22	NEG	I have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously.	1	1	1	1
22	NEG	I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie.	2	2	2	2

22	NEG	Then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled.				
22	NEG	Those actually had me in tears laughing.				
22	NEG	"If the ""special effects"" weren't proof enough that this was low-budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably locals which although good for the much-needed Phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money, have ever done anything since this series of movies."		3	3	3
22	NEG	They rented equipment, despite making sequels to this movie.

22	NEG	The thing that really had me going though, was not the music (which left me half expecting an animated Sargeant Slaughter from G.I.				
22	NEG	Joe to pop up), but the ending...I suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil, but when the American Ninja drops the girl into Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson drop the girl to catch him.				
22	NEG	I think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.	3

24	NEG	All that is outside one's country's border (and specially US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else.				
24	NEG	"The ""based on true events"" is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just to help pushing the film's ideology down some naÃ¯ve throats out there."		2	3	2
24	NEG	The perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories: Mexicans into disgusting people, Mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops, republicans into the right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth.	3	1	2	1

26	NEG	"""Northfork"" adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls."		2		2
26	NEG	Northfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation.				
26	NEG	"It's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents, all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for ""The Untouchables,"" have the job of relocating recalcitrant dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving."				
26	NEG	An exciting anti-development movie is always a possibility but let's get real: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in American history.				
26	NEG	Dams can be built without forced relocation?				
26	NEG	Not in this country.				
26	NEG	But this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination.				
26	NEG	Nick Nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear.				
26	NEG	"Alternating between the black-suited evacuation agents (working for ""lakefront"" land when the dam creates that valuable acreage) and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos, the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly."	3	1	3	1

30	NEG	'Rise of the Footsoldier' follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster Carlton Leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, guns, violence and did I mention violence?				
30	NEG	Protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of the I.C.F (Inner City Firm); a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters, guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 'Range Rover Killings', in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional 'hits'.				
30	NEG	Leach's success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters, profitably benefiting from the 80s/90s rave scene and drug culture.				
30	NEG	Opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but left wholly unsatisfied.				
30	NEG	The next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions.			3	
30	NEG	Each of these basically establishes yet another typical 'hard man', shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims, before probably coming to an even nastier end.				
30	NEG	What little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters (for example a family man blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are either anti-climactically killed, or their storyline left unresolved.		3		3
30	NEG	The hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events.		1		1
30	NEG	This film has been made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience who prefer violence and 'ard nut' slang to an actual storyline.				
30	NEG	'Rise of the Footsoldier' borrows too much from 'Football Factory', leaving out the good bits, demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist.		2		2
30	NEG	The violence, although brilliantly shot, seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment.	3		2	
30	NEG	The implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but machete-wielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer.				
30	NEG	The audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion.	2			
30	NEG	Attempted 'gritty-realism' is further destroyed with a substance called 'Truth Serum', which the Turkish Mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals.				
30	NEG	This is NOT the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and renders the interrogation almost absurd.	1		1	
31	POS	This film was a surprise.	1	1	1	1
31	POS	The plot synopsis sounds kinky, and stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page.				
31	POS	I didn't know what to expect.				
31	POS	There is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering, and very adult, mouth to mouth kiss.				
31	POS	The child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives.				
31	POS	He takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the headmistress, played by Page, her assistant and another student.				
31	POS	Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue, and the macabre all meld in this wonderfully original story.	2	2	2	2
31	POS	I've read the other comments here and find little to disagree with.				
31	POS	However, I wanted to clarify a point made earlier that there are no sympathetic characters in the film.				
31	POS	I find that there is one.				
31	POS	The attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it touches upon the common history of black women slaves taken advantage of by white men.		3	3	3
31	POS	Even though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience, she is what I would consider a sympathetic character.	3

32	NEG	I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the cast, I thought it was well acted.				
32	NEG	I particularly enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres' perfect deadpan performance.				
32	NEG	"What didn't work for me was: (1) the drawn-out affair with the younger man (too long, too seemingly out of character for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches, mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young woman feminist-scholar and, ironically, a fireworks scene (no wonder this reminded me of that horrid How to Make an American Quilt movie); (4) the bumbling ""gotcha"" cop who smells ""dope"" everywhere (no cliche there either!"	1	1	2	1
32	NEG	); and (5) a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting.	2	2	3	2
32	NEG	I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of (or even glorify) Helen's bitterness, to have included much more of DeGeneres' character, to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices, and to be a little less uncritical of small town life.			1

34	NEG	This was another one of those shows that I watched to root out the positive elements, and because I've been a Nick fan for years.				
34	NEG	Some of those would be the stage sets, B-plots, guest stars, and a few of the main actors that were good.			1	
34	NEG	I dabbled in the show through high school as I quickly grew to despise Jamie Spears, along with the other chicks in the show that can't act.				
34	NEG	The only characters I seemed to like were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan.				
34	NEG	Quinn is a perfect outcast that eventually started to fit in; Stacey is a complete oddball; Dustin gets put through a bunch of strange, random situations; and Michael is kind of the comic relief right-hand man of Logan.				
34	NEG	"There's a remarkable difference between the execution & acting quality of the B-plots that involve them, and the A-plots that showcased a bunch of screeching girls and an iconic ""Miss Perfect,"" repeating bad lines and obsessing over guys."		3		3

39	POS	Obviously from the reviews on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has divided those that have seen it.				
39	POS	I'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons.	1	1	1	1
39	POS	I feel this was a very ambitious (and quite competently pulled off...) undertaking for a bunch of 18/19 year olds with no budget and little experience.				
39	POS	I think that each aspect of the film - the direction, the acting (though the character's performances are more likened to stage or free-form performance because of the nature of the film...) the production, the FX, the score/sound design - all are far superior to many films I've seen that exceed these kids budget and experience ten-fold.		2	2	2
39	POS	"I honestly haven't been this impressed with an ""art-house"" style horror film since Nacho Cerda's GENESIS... First off - I'm not going to pretend to understand and/or grasp all of the graphical content in this film - but knowing that this wasn't a straight-narrative type of film when I went into it, I wasn't disappointed with how it played out."				
39	POS	"SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around the theory of right brain/left brain lust/anger/psychosis vs. restraint/compassion/""normalcy""."				
39	POS	"To very briefly give a synopsis of each ""chapter"": OVARIAN EYEBALL basically just has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut out of her abdomen."				
39	POS	I'm sure it's symbolic of something - I don't think I was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick.				
39	POS	"The next ""episode"" - HUMAN LARVAE - is a nihilistic, horrific, genuinely creepy story of a guy who's both in love with and repulsed by his pregnant sister, who gives into his growing psychosis which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter."				
39	POS	HUMAN LARVAE is the best of the bunch in my book, and will probably get under your skin.				
39	POS	The dead-pan narrative dialog accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen - but you're not quite sure what it is.				
39	POS	Do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film - don't do too much research on it.				
39	POS	Come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode.	2	3	3	3
40	NEG	Well, it wasn't a complete waste.		3	1	3
40	NEG	Armand was as usual very good in the movie,,,the whole turks vs German thing was kind of strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie...dint' bother to go back and check...the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in.	3			
40	NEG	Never saw a movie where the characters looked Italian, supposed to be Turk, taking English(American accent and euphemisms) with German words.

42	NEG	An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people.				
42	NEG	This beautifully crafted horrorÂ… well, actually it's more fantasy/romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life.				
42	NEG	Problem was that I spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button.	1	1		1
42	NEG	It sure would have sped up the film's slow pacing, but then again I wouldn't know about too much that was going on, which was reasonably hard to figure out or keep interest in the first place.	2		3	
42	NEG	The performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain dull, and that's probably because these characters are unconvincing, stale and coma inducing.	3	2	2	2
42	NEG	The actual back-story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messily put together, with too much focus on a flimsy romance, being laughable when it shouldn't be and overall it's constructed in an ordinary manner that just lacks the oomph or conviction to carry the film.		3	1	3
42	NEG	What compensates for the story's shortcomings are really arty images, which looked grand, but the use of some images had me somewhat dumbfounded to what they actually mean towards the film.				
42	NEG	What catches your eye is the faded colour scheme, but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy, or snowy.				
42	NEG	Although, from that it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, but also add some nice polished effects that goes well with the soothing but sometimes edgy score.				
42	NEG	The camera work was pretty diverse (although it didn't add too much to the feature), but during some of the more upbeat scenes there were too many close ups or dark lighting which made it hard to understand what you are seeing.				
42	NEG	Also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore, but not overtly grand or distinguishable from most other films.				
42	NEG	Lethargically odd film, with luminous images that look like something out of a painting, but still it isn't particularly enticing.

60	NEG	and you'll see the difference in their tight scripts, great comedic acting and timing, with each joke leading to the next one.

63	POS	In this story about Pall, a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd.	2			
63	POS	What is more, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors.				
63	POS	One of the other comments was already referring to another point: This movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening.				
63	POS	Despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and most of all sad.

73	POS	Played out in the picturesque, tranquil town of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a straight-out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for.				
73	POS	Perfectly embodying the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her work shift at a supermarket, takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki.

73	POS	Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then.				
73	POS	Opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young Minako vowing never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does as such with the narrative, patiently sticking with Minako as he, deftly aided by Tanako's understated yet highly effective performance, follows her -- whether she's having chitchat with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) on being single, or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and Kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years.	2	2		2

82	NEG	Every scene either takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location.				
82	NEG	If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would've ignored the film's budget (like in the case of Edward Burns' films), but obviously that's not the case this time around.				
82	NEG	"I quote Robert DeNiro from ""A Bronx Tale"" when I say, ""There's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent."""				
82	NEG	Everybody in the cast is talented.				
82	NEG	Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto--all talented performers!				
82	NEG	And they all have been in much better movies.				
82	NEG	The actors give it their all, but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script.				
82	NEG	The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods.				
82	NEG	And of course, there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning, which I also found appealing.				
83	POS	'A Tale of Two Sisters', or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece.	1		1	
83	POS	Brilliant psychological thriller, heart-wrenching drama, and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package.	2	3	2	2
83	POS	From the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary.	3	1	3	1
83	POS	For fear of revealing too much concerning the plot, I will just say it is very satisfying.				
83	POS	While it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first, it does a good job of explaining things in the end.				
83	POS	And whether you prefer psychological thriller, drama, or horror, I promise you will not be disappointed.

83	POS	I will certainly be looking into their other films.				
83	POS	Yeom Jeong-ah is deceitfully cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother.				
84	NEG	Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings.				
84	NEG	Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600's, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man's quest for power.				
84	NEG	Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Melbourne underworld.				
84	NEG	A film where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a gritty, violent, but critically flawed film.	1	1		1
84	NEG	Macbeth (Sam Worthington)works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet).				
84	NEG	After being elevated to the Thane of Glamis by The King (as was prophesied to Macbeth by three witches), Macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne.				
84	NEG	One night the King comes to stay at Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume power.				
84	NEG	Macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown.				
84	NEG	But success has it's downside, as Macbeth soon finds out, when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret.				
84	NEG	OK, first things first.				
84	NEG	The film's major fault is Sam Worthington.	2		3	
84	NEG	His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word... boring.		2	1	2
84	NEG	I honestly didn't care about Macbeth while watching the film.	3		2	
84	NEG	I had more sympathy for Victoria Hill's Lady Macbeth because she bothered to act at least.				
84	NEG	Worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film.		3		3
85	POS	This is a good movie, I won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that.	1	1	1	1

85	POS	That is just not a very defendable position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in.	2			
85	POS	I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never again appeared in another film or television show, in spite of giving good performances.		2		2

86	NEG	OK, so the husband is rich and cocky.				
86	NEG	There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife display plenty.				
86	NEG	The husband is a jerk because he - um, didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot BTW.				
86	NEG	The cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife.				
86	NEG	He then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him.				
86	NEG	Uh huh.				
86	NEG	The misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting.	2	1	2	1
86	NEG	It is one thing when a fine film like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims.	3

88	NEG	Marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother Brian she and Bob leave for New York after tracing his whereabouts.				
88	NEG	They get a hold of Brian, but still he doesn't know what they are talking about, but all the couple really want to know is where Brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son Joey... and even when they see Joey he doesn't know them either.				
88	NEG	The plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well.				
88	NEG	Experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting Bob and Marion in the same building as each other is beyond me.		3		3

91	POS	Everybody seems to be the culprit.

91	POS	I did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and It's also very believable.				
92	NEG	Richard Donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of South Africa.It's not as if America is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the Police Department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour.		1	1	1
92	NEG	So Donner's salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late = developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white South Africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself?				
92	NEG	"Inside Rudd's (Joss Ackland - eminently hissable) office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the Fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point,he and his men are referred to as ""nazis"" at regular intervals."				
92	NEG	"For me the only bright spot in the movie was when Mel Gibson turned up at an anti - apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription ""End Aparthied Now""."	2	2	2	2
92	NEG	The intensely irritating Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly-trained puppy.This would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat,but sadly he survives to irritate another day.	1	3	3	3
92	NEG	Miss Patsy Kensit seems in a world of her own,perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite Mel Gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere.Shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into Mel's caravan to keep the U.S. Army in Iraq going for six months.	3			
92	NEG	Fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack.I hope he got a special bone as a reward.				
92	NEG	The film climaxes(without interruption from Mel's dog) on a cargo ship bound for Nazi Germany (sorry,South Africa),when Mel and Danny murder so many members of the master race that I lost count.Despite jiggling around like Bonnie and Clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets,Mel survives,curled up in his partner's arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father.Take that,Apartheid!

93	POS	The 1990s was a great decade for British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY arriving onto TV screens for the first time.				
93	POS	However, MR. BEAN is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s.	1	1	1	1
93	POS	MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades.				
93	POS	It brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson.		3	3	3
93	POS	Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability.				
93	POS	However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context.				
93	POS	Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others.				
93	POS	Some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show.				
93	POS	This is where the humour derives from.	2			
93	POS	Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way.				
93	POS	And naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve.				
93	POS	Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it.				
93	POS	But no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring.				
93	POS	Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, inoffensive, harmless U-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy.		2	2	2
93	POS	It is for this reason why the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world.	3

94	NEG	"You'll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were ""borrowed"" from Airport 1977."				
94	NEG	This really doesn't scratch the surface...				
94	NEG	Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean, landing in, sinking, and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport '77.				
94	NEG	"All of the ""raising"" shots are pulled from '77, including most of the interior flooding clips, with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning."				
94	NEG	"I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment, or maybe a ""dead"" Tom Sullivan."				
94	NEG	Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that Airport '77's plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart of course).	3	3		3
94	NEG	This is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don't work much, or at least haven't worked in a while, which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker.	2	2	2	2
94	NEG	"I've rated this film a 2 - It's quite worthy of a ""1"", but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality, at least somebody helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert, and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!"	1	1	1	1

96	NEG	This movie is obviously on a big budget.				
96	NEG	"The effects are mostly top notch (except for one or two ""impacts"") and the cast is impressive."				
96	NEG	However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show.	2	2	1	2
96	NEG	Firstly, whoever decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired.	3	3	2	3
96	NEG	Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well.				
96	NEG	But his performance in this case is plain stupid, both with respect the lines uttered and the acting.			3	
96	NEG	So... something must be wrong with the script.				
96	NEG	I'd like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut instead.				
96	NEG	Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch.				
96	NEG	It is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath.				
96	NEG	In addition to this, the events that unfold are simply not credible.				
96	NEG	I'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie.				
96	NEG	Finally, the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action-biased.				
97	POS	Now I like Victor Herbert.	1	1		1
97	POS	And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones.	2	2		2

97	POS	Walter Connolly as Herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years Jones and Martin sing beautifully though.		Non sembra una recensione positiva		
97	POS	The Herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers.				
97	POS	Jones's John Ramsay is a frail character, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat who Jones also played.				
97	POS	As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career.				
97	POS	She did films with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one.				
97	POS	She performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her.			2	
97	POS	The best musical moment in the film is Jones and Martin in a duet of Thine Alone.		3	1	3
97	POS	The recordings I have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet.				
97	POS	There's also a pleasant scene with Jones and Martin riding bicycles swapping Herbert songs as they ride.			3	
97	POS	The real Victor Herbert with his womanizing and his Irish patriot background and his musical training in Germany where he developed a love for all things German would have been a fascinating study.				
97	POS	He was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing.				
97	POS	I have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert.				
98	NEG	This is a film with a lot of potential, well done and acted, with a rather week and inconsistent script.	1	1	1	1
98	NEG	"A young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment, because the husbands flat on top of the workshop where he cuts up stolen cars is aggravating their son's asthma.Husband ends up in jail when an ex pat's stolen car is traced to his shop, ex pat ends up being kind,generous and naive shmoe(and rather cardboard and we learn next to nothing of him ), but ends up with the girl, who ""trades up"" despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband."		3
