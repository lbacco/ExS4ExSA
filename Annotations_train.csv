0	NEG	"The loss of faith, regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be ""saved"" by the Hoover/God was not too bad."				
0	NEG	Unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough.				
0	NEG	A few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical Hoover up in the corner of the screen-beaming and nodding- would have added a lot.				
0	NEG	"The best aspect is Hoover only saving the deserving family and children WHO had ""proven"" their worth."				
0	NEG	Unfortunately, other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the Hoover-God doesn't help them.				
0	NEG	A better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition.				
0	NEG	Finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from the depression) should have rolled at the end.

2	NEG	The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.				
2	NEG	Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer.				3
2	NEG	The acting, in particular, was extremely poor.			2	1
2	NEG	Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating.		1		
2	NEG	The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson.	1	2	3	
2	NEG	The movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.	2			
2	NEG	Final say?				
2	NEG	Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion.	3

3	POS	Just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another,because as this film demonstrates,who's right is not foremost important,its who is popular,and feared which manipulates the minds of youths,and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen.Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim,and Brian Austin Green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved,and his best friend.This is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves.Remarkable,and brilliant,too good to be just a film made for TV.	2	1		1

4	NEG	As someone else mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat.				
4	NEG	Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains.	2			
4	NEG	First they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at, with increasing irritation to the audience, by Gaffari.	3	3		3

13	POS	"""Der Todesking"" is not exactly the type of film that makes you merryÂ… JÃ¶rg Buttgereit's second cult monument in a row, which is actually a lot better than the infamous ""Nekromantik"", exists of seven short episodes Â– one for each day of the week Â– revolving on unrelated people's suicides."				
13	POS	In between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse.				
13	POS	"The episodes aren't all equally powerful but, as a wholesome, ""Der Todesking"" is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films."	2			
13	POS	Particularly the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one of Sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead, are extremely intense and devastating to observe.				
13	POS	The added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like it, is debatable and I'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here.				
13	POS	There's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically.				
13	POS	"Entirely unlike I expected, ""Der Todesking"" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic!"			3	
13	POS	On the contrary actually, I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery.		2		2
13	POS	The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names, ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen.	3			
13	POS	The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema.

16	NEG	DarkWolf tells the tale of a young waitress named Josie (Samaire Armstrong) who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend Mary (Tippi Hedren) is killed by a Werewolf, you see Werewolves actually exist in modern day America & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the Werewolf threat headed up by Detective Steve Turley (Ryan Olosio) who has the difficult task of telling Josie that she is in fact a pure blooded Werewolf herself & that a so-called 'dark prince' Werewolf (Kane Hodder) wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood Werewolves that will take over the entire world, or something like that.				
16	NEG	Understandably Josie has a hard time believing it, that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes.				
16	NEG	It's up to Werewolf cop Steve to save Josie, the day & the world... Co-executive produced & directed Richard Friedman I thought DarkWolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me.		2		2
16	NEG	The script by Geoffrey Alan Holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there's a Werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way I'm afraid.				
16	NEG	For a start it's slow going, it's dull, it's predictable & it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the Werewolf they don't, I have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead.				
16	NEG	The script is dumb & doesn't explain itself, why has Josie never turned into a Werewolf before?	1	3		3
16	NEG	Is she really the only one?				
16	NEG	Why can't this 'dark prince' find another female Werewolf?				
16	NEG	There are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half-way through but you get the idea anyway, as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least.			2	
16	NEG	Director Friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle.	3			
16	NEG	Now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in DarkWolf are far from special, the Werewolf transformation is achieved using CGI & it's among the worst looking CGI I've ever seen, seriously a Playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics.				
16	NEG	It's easily the worst Werewolf transformation I've ever seen, An American Werewolf in London (1981) was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light-years ahead of the ones seen in DarkWolf, who says special effects have improved over the years?	2	1	3	1
16	NEG	The animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen.				
16	NEG	The gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else.				
16	NEG	Thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it, is it really worth it?			1

24	NEG	The jackasses playing the Clampets/Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!	2			
24	NEG	Finally, the action.				
24	NEG	The gunfighting is so-so at BEST, and the fist-fighting is deplorable.

26	NEG	Another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment!		1	2	1
26	NEG	I found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the Schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot.				
26	NEG	I bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well, but it lacks Pixar's writing and soul.				
26	NEG	I think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule, while missing the plot.				
26	NEG	People old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily.

28	NEG	Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen, and doubt I will.	1		3	
28	NEG	It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon).		1		1
28	NEG	Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that.	3			
28	NEG	He's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach.				
28	NEG	The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot.			2	
28	NEG	Not Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both.		3		3
28	NEG	Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together.	2			
28	NEG	Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on.				
28	NEG	And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago.				
28	NEG	But of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions.

32	NEG	Christopher Plummer looks winded as Van Helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of Van Helsing but the real thing; he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from Count Dracula's corpse, which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and flown to New Orleans.	2	3	3	3

33	POS	A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste.

42	NEG	I was certainly wrong.				
42	NEG	The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters.		1	3	1
42	NEG	There wasn't anything romantic about it.

42	NEG	At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later.				
42	NEG	There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies.				
42	NEG	Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and I kept asking myself when it was going to end.	2	3		3
42	NEG	The death of John Howard was completely predictable.	3			
42	NEG	There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever.			2	
42	NEG	It wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot.				
42	NEG	Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard.				
42	NEG	The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs.

43	POS	The show is less than an hour long.				
43	POS	I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting.				
43	POS	I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season.				
43	POS	I felt this show took chances and often it worked.		3		2
43	POS	It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London.

44	NEG	Though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona.				
44	NEG	The film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes.		1	3	1
44	NEG	"No, ""Noise"" isn't all-bad."				
44	NEG	William Hurt is at least colorful.				
44	NEG	At least the ending doesn't fall flat.				
44	NEG	Overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven't probably thought of.				
44	NEG	At least I hadn't.				
44	NEG	Though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn't have ended sooner.		3		3
44	NEG	The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.	1		1	
45	POS	Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness.	2			
45	POS	This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture.		1	1	1
45	POS	"The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life."				
45	POS	The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing.		2	2	3
45	POS	It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller.	3		3	
45	POS	And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.	1	3		2

46	NEG	No ,I'm not kidding.				
46	NEG	If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio.	1			
46	NEG	I'm serious.				
46	NEG	Their movies are exactly the same in every one, and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem which they easily resolve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends.		3		3
46	NEG	Think about it.				
46	NEG	If you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me its name.				
46	NEG	"These ""movies"" are poor excuses to be on TV and go to other countries."	2	2	2	2
46	NEG	There is a reason that the movies never go to theaters.			3	
46	NEG	I'm sure that when they were really young and made some O.K.				
46	NEG	movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that they're, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money.				
46	NEG	Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY!	3	1	1	1

47	POS	This review is for the extended cut of this movie.				
47	POS	I first watched Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago.				
47	POS	I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.	1	1	1	1
47	POS	That being said.				
47	POS	I've always found the storyline a bit confusing.				
47	POS	The movie is, after all, a love story.				
47	POS	And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene.				
47	POS	Well, in the extended version this is no longer so.				
47	POS	"The old ""original"" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version."				
47	POS	The opening sequence is Dragon(Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.	3			
47	POS	Other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it.			2	
47	POS	The pacing is also better and overall it just works better.	2	2		3
47	POS	It feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does.		3	3	2
47	POS	I suggest everyone who is a Hong-Kong cinema, or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.				
47	POS	(Or at least that's how I think it was intended.				
48	NEG	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth.				
48	NEG	Unfortunately, her role required no.	2			
48	NEG	She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film.	1		1	
48	NEG	Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance).				
48	NEG	Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles.				
48	NEG	I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for.				
48	NEG	She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act.				
48	NEG	This seems like something that Hollywood does often.				
48	NEG	Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban.				
48	NEG	I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes.	3	2		2
48	NEG	She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice.		1	2	1
48	NEG	If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.		3	3	3

49	POS	"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."""				
49	POS	This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion.				
49	POS	Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life.				
49	POS	He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist.		3		3
49	POS	This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.		1	2	1
49	POS	Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it.				
49	POS	You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour).				
49	POS	"The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes""."	3			
49	POS	Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand.				
49	POS	I think the end is perfect though.	1	2	3	2
49	POS	I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.	2		1
